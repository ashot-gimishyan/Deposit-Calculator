# Compound Interest Calculator

The Compound Interest Calculator is a Python application built using the tkinter and matplotlib libraries to calculate and visualize compound interest growth over time. This calculator provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input their initial deposit, annual interest rate, and interest frequency to see how their money grows over time.

### Features

    1. Calculate compound interest growth based on initial deposit, annual interest rate, and interest frequency.
    2. Visualize the growth over time using interactive graphs.
    3. Save the generated graph as a PNG image.
    4. Animate the growth over time to see the progression.
